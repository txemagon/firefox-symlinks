<p>This section describes how to use the Help window (the entire window in
  which this text and the Sidebar on the left are displayed).</p>

<div class="contentsBox">In this section:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#finding_the_topic_you_want">Kuidas leida soovitud teema</a></li>
    <li><a href="#search_tips">Otsinguvihjed</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2 id="finding_the_topic_you_want">Kuidas leida soovitud teema</h2>

<p>When you're viewing the Help window, click the tabs in the left frame to view
  the Help contents in different ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Contents</strong> shows the list of main topics.<br/>
    Click a topic to read about it. Double-click to see its subtopics.</li>
  <li><strong>Search</strong> lets you search the Help files.<br/>
    Type a word or phrase to see related topics. Then click the topic you want
    to read about.  If your search doesn't return any topics, try typing fewer
    words or a different combination of words.</li>
  <li><strong>Index</strong> lists topics alphabetically.<br/>
    Click an index entry to view information on that topic.</li>
  <li><strong>Glossary</strong> lists definitions alphabetically.<br/>
    Click a glossary term to see its definition.</li>
</ul>

<p>To see information related to the Help topic you are reading, click links in
  the Help window just as you would in a regular web page.  You can also move
  back and forth between pages you've already seen using the Back and Forward
  buttons.</p>

<h2 id="search_tips">Otsinguvihjed</h2>

<p>Kui sa ei leia, mida otsid, siis siin on paar kasulikku vihjet:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be sure that you are searching for something that relates to
    &brandShortName;; this is not a general Internet search.</li>
  <li>Try to broaden your search - don't be too specific; terms could be worded
    differently than your search.</li>
  <li>Avoid being too broad with your search.  For example, a common word like
    &quot;page&quot; will probably return more topics than you want.</li>
</ul>
